Project Title: 
Dine in or out (Satisfy ..your cravings)

Project Description: 
This application will allow the users to find and save recipes by choosing available ingredients. It will also recommend possible eating locations using geolocalization of the user.

User Story:

**AS a person** who wants to have a meal 

**I want** to easily assess if I have the right ingredients to make a meal or if there is an eatery nearby.

**SO that I** can decide if I want to make a meal at home or go out for a meal.
